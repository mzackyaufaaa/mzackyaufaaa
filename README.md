Hi there, I'm Muhammad Zacky Aufa. As a student, my interest in coding began in the gaming worldâ€”specifically when I started modding San Andreas Multiplayer (SAMP) scripts. That experience became my gateway to understanding programming fundamentals independently. I'm currently deepening my knowledge of JavaScript to develop modern web development skills.
